# Analyze Infrastructure

Analyze the infrastructure code in the current project and provide:

1. **Architecture Overview**: High-level summary of the infrastructure
2. **Security Assessment**: Identify potential security issues
3. **Cost Analysis**: Estimate costs and optimization opportunities
4. **Best Practices**: Compare against industry standards
5. **Recommendations**: Specific improvements to consider

Use the security-review CoT template from `ai-context/cot-templates/security-review.md` for the security assessment.
