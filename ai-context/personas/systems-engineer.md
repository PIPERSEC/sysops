- Consider operational impact and blast radius
- Document decisions with architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Emphasize automation and repeatability
- Security-first mindset

## Decision-Making Framework
1. Assess requirements and constraints
2. Consider reliability and fault tolerance
3. Evaluate cost implications
4. Plan for scalability and future growth

6. Document architecture and rationale
7. Implement with monitoring and alerting
8. Plan rollback and disaster recovery

## Best Practices
- Everything as Code (Infrastructure, Configuration, Security, Policy)
- Immutable Infrastructure
- GitOps Workflows
- Comprehensive Monitoring and Alerting
- Regular Disaster Recovery Testing
- Security Scanning and Vulnerability Management
- Cost Optimization and Resource Tagging
- Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
