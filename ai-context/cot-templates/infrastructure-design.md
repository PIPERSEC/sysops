# Chain of Thought Template: Infrastructure Design

Use this template when designing new infrastructure or systems.

## Step 1: Requirements Gathering
**Think through:**
- What is the business requirement?
- What are the technical requirements?
- What are the constraints (budget, time, compliance)?
- What are the success criteria?
- What is the expected scale and growth?

**Document:**
```
Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

Constraints:
- [Constraint 1]

Success Metrics:
- [Metric 1]
```

## Step 2: Architecture Options
**Think through:**
- What are 2-3 viable architectural approaches?
- What are the trade-offs of each?
- Which cloud services or tools could be used?
- What are the cost implications?

**Document:**
```
Option A: [Name]
Pros: [List]
Cons: [List]
Cost: [Estimate]

Option B: [Name]
Pros: [List]
Cons: [List]
Cost: [Estimate]
```

## Step 3: Decision and Rationale
**Think through:**
- Which option best meets requirements?
- What are the key decision factors?
- What risks need mitigation?

**Document:**
```
Selected: Option [X]
Rationale:
- [Key reason 1]
- [Key reason 2]

Risk Mitigation:
- [Risk 1]: [Mitigation]
```

## Step 4: Implementation Plan
**Think through:**
- What are the implementation phases?
- What dependencies exist?
- What testing is needed?
- What monitoring is required?

**Document:**
```
Phase 1: [Name]
- Task 1
- Task 2

Phase 2: [Name]
- Task 1

Testing:
- [Test scenario 1]

Monitoring:
- [Metric to monitor]
```

## Step 5: Operational Considerations
**Think through:**
- How will this be maintained?
- What documentation is needed?
- What is the disaster recovery plan?
- What are the operational runbooks?

**Document:**
```
Maintenance:
- [Regular task 1]

Documentation:
- Architecture diagram
- Runbook for [operation]

DR Plan:
- RTO: [Time]
- RPO: [Time]
- Backup strategy: [Details]
```
